 |    Summary: This style sheet is applied to all admin or root user pages,
 |             these pages are different to the generally accessed pages, with
 |             lots of very wide tables, so it is useful to be able to style
 |             them independently of the rest of the system.
 |
 |  IMPORTANT: Rename this file from admin_dist.css to admin.css to make use of
 |             it.
