BUG FIXES

-----------------------------

OTHER CHANGES
Moved over to a MVC style 'framework' to more easily allow customisation of the front-end.  This version required PHP 5.5 or greater.

Configuration variable "LIST_GROUPS_LABEL".  Entering a value of "1" will use a default label of "Group" as the select group label.

All drop-down fields now store the selected item in lower-case.  This may cause unwanted results if you roll-back to v8.x after you have gone live.  All funny characters are either converted to their safe equivalent (Ã¢ becomes a) or removed entirely (such as quotes).  This does mean that you cannot have D'Lure and DLure as unique entities.

If a character has entered an ancestor or group name manually and this has then been added into the appropriate list as a valid option, the correct option in the drop down should be selected automatically.

Character Skill form has been given a complete overhaul and uses a 50/50 mix of information from the database and hard-coded details within the form.  This ensures that pre-requisite CS's are correctly selected - i.e. you cannot have Healing 2 without Healing 1.


DEPRACATED
jQuery has been entirely removed for a pure JavaScript flavour.  This has reduced the overhead of all areas of the site and improved the page performance significantly.

Configuration variable "NUM_GUILDS".  You can now select as many guilds as has been configured in the back-end, these are controlled using JavaScript and hidden input fields.

"Other" option within ancestors and groups.  The choice of "other" is now hard-coded into the front-end of the website, this has allowed us to hide/show the other box, reducing the clutter on screen.
