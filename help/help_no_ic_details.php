If you provide IC details, you may be able to play your character at some point during the event. If you have no wish to play your character, you may choose not to provide any IC details. In this case, tick the &quot;<b>I do not want to play my character</b>&quot; box, and click the &quot;<b>I do not want to play my character</b>&quot; button.
