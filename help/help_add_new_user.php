<p>
If a user sends in a paper booking form, use this page to create the user on the system. You can then add their OOC &amp; IC details by editing them as you can edit any other user.
</p>
<p>
Note that the user will not have a password set, and so will not be able to log in. If they later want to log in and edit their own details, they can request a new password using the <a href = "../retrieve.php" target="main">Get a new password</a> link on the main page.
